  <h2>CSS</h2>

<p>
  Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for<br>
  describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language<br>
  like HTML.[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, <br>
  alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2]
  CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content,<br>
  including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve content<br>
  accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of<br>
  presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting<br>
  by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, and reduce complexity<br>
  and repetition in the structural content.
  Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the <br>
  same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods, such as<br>
  on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader),<br>
  and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate <br>
  formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.[4]
  The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine <br>
  which style rule applies if more than one rule matches a particular element.<br>
  This cascading priority scheme is predictable.
