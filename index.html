  <h2>WEB</h2>

<p>
The World Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as the Web, is an information<br>
system where documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform<br>
Resource Locators (URLs, such as https://www.example.com/), which may be <br>
interlinked by hypertext, and are accessible over the Internet.[1][2]<br>
The resources of the WWW are transferred via the Hypertext Transfer <br>
Protocol (HTTP) and may be accessed by users by a software application<br>
called a web browser and are published by a software application called<br>
a web server.
